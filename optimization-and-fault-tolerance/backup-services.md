# Backup Services

Backup Services

There is also backup services.

Some computers have backup services to keep your network in constant operation.

Ex - A standby server is not being used but its data is constantly being updated with the primary server.

If a primary server fails, the standby server takes over.

Another type of backup services would be server clustering.

Server clustering is when a group of servers work together for load balancing and fault tolerance.

In this setup, the servers will share the workload if one of the servers fail.

This type of setup works best when servers are in different geographical locations.

So, if some kind of natural disaster would happen in one location, it would not effect the other servers.
