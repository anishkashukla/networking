# Optimization and Fault Tolerance

Optimization and Fault Tolerance

Bandwidth shaper -

Used to control network traffic.

You can use it to set upload and download limits on less important data such as recreation.

You can also prioritize important data like business needs and make sure that it has the highest uploads and downloads limits.

Traffic Shaping -

Similar to what bandwidth shaper does.

It prioritizes applications and guarantees bandwidth for more important services.

Load Balancer -

It is a piece of hardware or software that is used to evenly distribute data activity across a network so that no single computer or server becomes overwhelmed with the workload.

Ex - In a network, one server is getting more network activity than the other server so to resolve it, we can add a load balancer so that both servers are sharing the network activity evenly.

QoS \(Quality of Service\) -

In computer networking, this is the term that is used to provide a guarantee of data delivery within a certain period of time.

Port Blocking -

It is one of the ways to provide security to the network.

Port blocking is done on the firewall and as a network administrator you can control which ports should be open or closed depending upon the application.

It is a great way to keep the network safe but it can also cause problems if you mistakenly close the wrong ports.

High Availability -

It is a term that is used to guarantee a period of uptime of continual operation.

Power Fault Tolerance -

In case of power failure, we need to do something that no further problems occur because of it so we need to use an UPS.

UPS \(Uninterrupted Power Supply\) -

It is a battery backup that supplies power to your equipment if a power cut were to happen.

In additional to supplying backup power, UPS also protect against surges and spikes.

Link Redundancy -

Having a continuous connection to a network in the event of a failure.

Ex - If you are using a broadband connection, you can have an ISDN line as a backup if the broadband line were to fail or you can also have a secondary network card \(NIC\) by having one as a primary and other one as secondary.

So if the primary card were to fail, the secondary card is there so that you can still have a continuous connection.
