# Types of Topologies

Star Topology -

In this, all computers are connected to a central wiring point such as a hub or a switch. All the data on a star network passes through this central point before continuing to its destination. One of the major benefits of this topology is that if one computer fails or if there was break in the cable, the other computers will not be affected as each computer has their own cable connection. Disadvantage is that if the central hub fails, then all the computers will be affected. This is called a single point of failure. The entire network goes down if it happens.

Bus Topology - Very old topology and is not used these days that much. In this, each of the computer or network devices are connected to a single cable or backbone. This backbone is the coaxial cable. The computers connect to this cable using special connectors called BNC or T-connections. Advantages - Cheap and easy to implement. Disadvantage - It requires that the cable be terminated at both ends using terminators. In order for the setup to be main operational, it must not have any open connections including the ends. Bouncing back of the data due to open connections is called signal reflection.

Ring Topology - It is a type of network configuration where each computers are connected to each other in a shape of a closed loop or ring. Every computer has two neighbors for communication purposes. Each data packet is sent around the ring until it reaches its final destination. These are rarely used today. Advantage - These are easy to install and easy to troubleshoot. Disadvantage - If one of the computers goes down or if there is a single break in the break, then all the data flow would be disrupted.

Mesh Topology - Each computer on the network connects to every other computer on the network. So having so many connections, it handles failures very well. Rarely used as it is costly. Mainly used on WAN. Internet is a perfect example of mesh technology. Advantage - It creates a high redundancy level because if one or more connections fail, the computers will still be able to communicate with each other.

Hybrid Topology -

Hybrid topologies are a combination of different topologies. A lot of businesses use some form of a hybrid technology to suit their growing needs. Common forms of hybrid topologies - Star ring networks Star bus networks Star Bus Network - In this, two or more star topologies are linked together using a single bus connection.

Star Ring Network - In this, two or more star topologies are linked together to form a large ring network.

Point to Point Topology - In this, two hosts are directly connected to each other using a single cable. These hosts can be computers switches, routers, servers etc.

Client Server Topology - In this, clients connect directly to a centralized dedicated server to access resources rather than connecting to each other. A lot of business use this kind of topology. The admin can put all the data in one machine rather than putting in all the machines.

Point to Multipoint Topology - It is the network architecture that is commonly used in wireless outdoor networks. There will be a central wireless base station. Then there will be other wireless locations around it that connect to the single central location. These other locations would not directly communicate to the other locations, they will all only communicate to the central location. So there wireless locations are commonly called clients. The central location is commonly called as Access point or Base station.
