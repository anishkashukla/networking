WAN Technologies

When data is sent across a network, it is not sent as one large piece. The data is actually divided into smaller pieces or data packets and then they are sent individually.

These data packets are sent using two different methods -

Packet Switching Circuit Switching

Packet Switching -

In packet switching, the data packets take different routes to their destination.

Once all the data packets reach their destination, they are recompiled into the original message.

This method of communication is also known as connectionless.

The internet mostly uses packet switching technology.

Circuit Switching -

Circuit Switching also sends data packets individually but unlike packet switching which sends data on different routes, circuit switching does the opposite.

In circuit switching, all the data is sent along the same dedicated route.

Ex - Telephone line.

ISDN \(Integrated Services Digital Network\) -

This is an international standard for digital transmission over ordinary telephone lines.

Users have to install ISDN modem in order to use them.

This was a significant improvement of speed over the standard 56kbps modem.

ISDN sends data at 128 kbps.

T1 \(T carrier level 1\) -

T1 lines are probably the most commonly used internet services for businesses today.

It is a dedicated connection that supports data rates of 1.544 Mbps.

T1 line consists of 24 individual channels that carries a rate of 64 kbps.

Each of these channels can carry data or noise traffic.

T3 \(T carrier level 3\) -

A T3 line is a high speed internet connection that supports rates of 43 Mbps.

It consists of 672 individual channels that carries a rate of 64 kbps.

Mainly used by ISPs that connect directly to the backbone of the internet.

E1 Line -

Similar to T1 line.

It is a format used in Europe for digital transmission.

Speed is 2 Mbps.

Consists of 32 channels that carry 64 kbps of data.

E3 Line -

European equivalent of a T3 line.

Has a speed of 34 Mbps.

Has fewer channels than a T3 line.

OCx \(Optical Carrier\) -

These are levels that describes the speed of networks that can be carried on SONET \(Synchronous Optical Network\).

Fiber-cable technology that delivers voice, data and video at high speeds.

The OC levels are calculated by multiples of 51.84 Mbps.

OC Level Oc-1 Speed 51.84 Mbps

OC Level Oc-3 X 51.84 Speed 155.52 Mbps

OC Level Oc-12 X 51.84 Speed 622.08 Mbps

OC Level Oc-24 X 51.84 Speed 1.244 Gbps

OC Level Oc-48 X 51.84 Speed 2.488 Gbps

OC Level Oc-122 X 51.84 Speed 9.953 Gbps
