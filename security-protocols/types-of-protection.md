# Types of Protection

Types of Protection

Provides protection in 3 ways -

Authenticates the server. Authenticates the client. Encrypts the data.

TLS \(Transport Layer Security\) -

It is the latest industry standard SSL protocol - it is the successor to SSL.

It is based on the same specifications.

Authenticates to server, the client and encrypts the data TLS is made up of 2 layers -

TLS Record Protocol -

Provides connection security by making sure the connection is private and reliable.

TLS Handshake Protocol -

Allows the server and client to authenticate each other and negotiate an encryption algorithm and cryptographic keys before data is sent.

The goal for TLS is to make SSL safer and more secure.

802.1x -

Used for both wired and wireless networks.

Controls network access by ports.

Port based authentication so if authentication passes, the port is opened and if the authentication fails, the port is closed.
