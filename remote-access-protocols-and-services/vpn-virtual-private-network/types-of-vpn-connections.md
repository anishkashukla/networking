# Types of VPN connections

There are 3 different types of VPN connections -

VPN \(Site to Site\) -

This is when an organization has two offices at different geographical locations and they want these offices to be networked and share data with each other over the public internet.

So they just need to set up a site to site VPN connection and the VPN will encrypt the data as it goes through the internet and then decrypt the data as it enter the organization's private network creating a site to site VPN.

VPN \(Host to Site\) -

If you are at home with your computer and you need to connect to your office at a different location so you can access files then you would need to setup a host to site VPN connection.

This doesn’t require any additional hardware on your end at home to establish this type of connection.

Need to connect to VPN hardware that is in your office.

Once the connection is made, you can access your office’s network over the internet.

So, all the special VPN hardware would be on the office or site side of the connection and not at home.

VPN \(Host to Host\) -

When you want to establish a VPN connection between two computers over the internet.

This doesn’t require any additional VPN hardware at either end.

It only requires a software on each computer to create a simple host to host VPN connection.
