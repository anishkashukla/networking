# VPN \(Virtual Private Network\)

VPN \(Virtual Private Network\) -

A private communications network that uses a public network \(such as internet\) to establish a remote connection.

Encrypts data when sending and decrypts data when receiving.

Provides a dedicated link between two points over the internet.

VPN Concentrator -

The VPN is created and managed by using a VPN Concentrator.

VPN concentrator is a device that creates the VPN connections and manages the delivery of the messages between the VPN computers and devices.

Authenticate users, encrypts the data and assigns tunnel/ IP addresses to users.

Not always needed to manage and create VPNs. Mostly used in organizations that are going to use a lot of VPN connections and they need a decide to handle the heavy traffic that VPNs create.

If an organization is only going to use small amount of VPN connections then they can just use the VPN software that is built into their router or firewall rather than using a VPN concentrator.
