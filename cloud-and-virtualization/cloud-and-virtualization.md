# Cloud and Virtualization

Cloud and Virtualization

The traditional way in which a business operates is by using different machines or servers to run different services according to what the business need.

For ex - A business would need/use a server to run the database, another server would be used to run the website, another server would be used to run their email service and so on.

These servers also could be running different operating system.

It can be expensive.

So, we go for virtualization.

Virtualization -

It is basically consolidating all of these physical servers with their different operating system and applications and running them on just one physical server in a virtual environment.

One server will run all other different applications like databases, web services and email all running side by side on one machine.

Not only the applications but also runs different operating system side by side.

Virtualization saves money.

In addition to virtual servers, there are other virtual devices such as virtual switches.

Virtual Switch -

It is not a physical switch but it is a software switch as created in a virtual environment.

Ex- If you want your virtual database server to be able to network and communicate to your virtual web server, you can just add a virtual switch to do that.

Once the switch is added then those two virtual servers can now communicate with each other.

Virtual Router -

Virtual Router perform just like a physical router.

It can route data packets between your virtual servers and the internet according to what the business needs are.

Virtual Firewall -

A virtual device that can filter network traffic and monitor that traffic for your virtual servers just like a physical firewall does.
