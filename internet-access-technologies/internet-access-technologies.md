Internet Access Technologies

DSL \(Digital Subscriber Line\) -

This is a popular technology that is used by homes and businesses to access broadband data over the internet.

The advantage of DSL is that it can carry both voice and data at the same time.

It has a DSL modem that uses common telephone lines to carry its data.

It is a high speed connection that is much faster than your regular dial-up modem.

There are few different forms of DSL and one is called ADSL.

ADSL \(Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line\) -

This is called Asymmetric because the download speed is considerably faster than the upload speed.

This type of DSL is typically used in homes and is the cheapest form of DSL.

SDSL \(Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line\) -

In this, the download and the upload speeds are the same.

This type is typically used in businesses.

VDSL \(Very High Bit Rate DSL\) -

This is a very fast form of DSL.

It has download speeds over 50 Mbps over copper wire.

But because it uses copper wire, it is only make for short distances.

For long distances, VDSL cab use fiber optic cable.

Cable Broadband -

It uses a cable modem with an attached coaxial cable modem with an attached coaxial cable which provides a ink to the internet service provider.

Like DSL, cable is very fast with speeds of 50 mega bytes or more.

Cable is typically provided by the same provider that provide cable television to their customer.

POTS / PSIN \(Plain Old Telephone Service/Public Switched Telephone Network\) -

In these, there are plane old telephone lines.

Slowly becoming obsolete by people who use the internet because of the slow speed.

Telephone lines do have an advantage and that is that they are basically everywhere and they are fairly cheap to use.

Satellite -

Satellite communication is pretty expensive and is mainly used where no other services are provided like phones,cables or DSL.

But because of the increasing availability of these other options, satellite is rarely used.

Speed has increased throughout the year with maximum speed around 50 Mbps with only a fraction of that in upload speeds.

Mobile Hotspots -

Mobile hotspots are portable devices that use cellular networks to connect wireless devices to the internet.

So if there are wireless devices within 30 feet of the mobile hotspot, they can join it and then they will have access to the internet.

It comes in two forms -

They will either be a free standing device or they can come as a feature built into a smart phone.

Mobile hotspots are available through cellphone carriers like AT&T, T Mobile etc.

WIMAX -

It is another broadband internet technology.

Much like our home wireless network where it covers your home, WIMAX covers much longer areas.

WIMAX is basically a “super” wireless network that covers entire cities or countries.

WIMAX works with WIMAX towers that are scattered in different geographical locations and these towers directly connect to Internet Service Provider \(ISP\) using a T3 line.

Each tower covers a certain area just like a cellphone tower does.

To pickup the transmission of these towers, we need a receiver in our home or computer to receive the signal.

After receiving, you can access the internet.

It can provide internet access to places where cable and DSL can’t reach.

Metro Ethernet -

It is a Metropolitan Area Network \(MAN\) that is based on ethernet standards.

Basically used to connect businesses and residential users to a larger network such as the internet using Ethernet.

Simple and cheap to use because it doesn’t require any specialized cabling and equipment.
