# Stateful vs Stateless Firewalls

Stateful vs Stateless Firewalls

Firewalls inspect traffic in a couple of different ways. One way is called stateful

Stateful –

It monitors all the connections and data streams that are passing through.

Keeps a record. It uses the connection information that comes from the applications and previous sessions and factors that in allowing or denying the flow of data packets.

It does a thorough job of protecting a network dynamically.

Stateless –

Does not do a thorough job as a stateful firewall does

It used an Access Control List \(ACL\) to allow or deny traffic

It does not thoroughly inspects a data packet

It only looks into the header portion of the data packet.

It does not keep a record of previous data packets.
