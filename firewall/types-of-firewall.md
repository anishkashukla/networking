# Types of Firewall

Types of Firewall

1. Host Based Firewall-

Software firewall

This is a type of firewall that is installed on a computer and it protects that computer only and nothing else

Latest versions of Microsoft O.S. come packed with a host based firewall.

3rd party firewalls are also available.

1. Network Based Firewall-

It is a combination of hardware and software and it operates at a network layer.

It is placed between the private network and the internet.

Unlike a host based firewall, which only protects its own computer.

A network based firewall protects an entire network.

It does this through management rows that is applied to the entire network so that any harmful activity can be stopped before it reaches the computers.
