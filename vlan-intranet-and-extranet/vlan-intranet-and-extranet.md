# VLAN, Intranet and Extranet

VLAN, Intranet and Extranet

VLANs \(Virtual Local Area Network\) -

It is a logical area network that controls network traffic regardless of the physicalities of the location.

By installing a VLAN switch, you can logically create several virtual networks to separate network broadcast traffic.

Intranet -

An intranet is a private network that belongs to an organization.

This is usually an internal website and only the employees of that organization can access.

The website usually contains the information about the company.

The website is also behind the firewall so no one outside the company can access it.

Extranet -

An extranet is similar to intranet.

It is a private network that can be accessible from outside the organization on a restricted basis.
